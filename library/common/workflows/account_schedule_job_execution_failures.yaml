                    Assess the state of Vault and any errors logged to determine whether to ignore the failure or retry the job execution.

                    Examples of when to retry job executions are transient errors, such as severe service or infrastructure downtime.
                    Job executions should not be retried when the failure was caused by an invalid contract template.
