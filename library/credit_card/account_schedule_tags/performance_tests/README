Unlike normal account schedule tags that are needed in general for operation event notifications,
account schedule tags within this directory are for overriding in order to facilitate e2e and/or performance tests.
These are CLU-like with the exception of timestamp fields:
- test_pause_at_timestamp
- schedule_status_override_start_timestamp
- schedule_status_override_end_timestamp
So that the timestamps can be set relative to runtime instead of being hardcoded. 
As a result, the actual payload uploaded into vault will be created via the e2e test framework
based on the "configs" here.
Timestamp fields support two options:
1 - A normal value (null or a timestamp). This is CLU compatible
2 - A 'delta' dictionary whose key-value pairs are used to initialise a relativedelta object which
    is added to datetime.now(timezone.utc). This allows test writers to ensure the pause is set
    appropriately for the relevant schedule
