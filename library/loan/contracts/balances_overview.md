# Overview of balances used in the loan contract for the loan account

This overview is aimed at providing an initial introduction into understanding the inner works of the loan product and helping a contract writer in figuring out how the many balances inside the loan are used and how different events are reflected in the balances.

## List of addresses used by the loan account

Below you can find a list of all 14 addresses used by the loan account in the smart contract, together with a short description about the role they have:

* PRINCIPAL
    * Tracks remaining principal amount as if the standard repayment schedule is followed (overpayments and capitalised amounts are excluded)
    * Money gets moved out of this address at:
        * account activation
            * principal disbursement into deposit account
            * upfront fee disbursement into upfront fee account (if there is no amortisation of upfront fee, the fee amount will be added back to PRINCIPAL)
    * Money gets moved into this address at:
        * account closure (zeroing out addresses that track changes outside of standard declining principal repayments)
            * transferring principal capitalised interest amount
            * transferring overpayments
            * transferring EMI principal excess amount
        * repayment day schedule

## Repayment hierarchy

Another important piece of information is the order of the addresses that get updated when the customer performs a repayment.
The contract is using the following hierarchy:

1. PRINCIPAL_OVERDUE
2. INTEREST_OVERDUE
3. PENALTIES
4. PRINCIPAL_DUE
5. INTEREST_DUE
6. PRINCIPAL
7. ACCRUED_INTEREST
8. ACCRUED_OVERDUE_INTEREST_PENDING_CAPITALISATION

## Basic example of loan lifecycle

The simulation test `test_regular_events` (located in library/loan/contracts/tests/simulation/loan_test.py) has been created in order to show how the different addresses get updated depending on different account events. We can see an overview of those events and the movement of money in the table below:

| EVENT | PRINCIPAL | PRINCIPAL DUE | PRINCIPAL OVERDUE | INTEREST DUE | INTEREST OVERDUE | OVERPAYMENTS | PENALTIES | EMI PRINCIPAL EXCESS | PRINCIPAL CAPITALISED INTEREST | CAPITALISED INTEREST OVERDUE | DEPOSIT ACCOUNT | LATE REPAYMENT FEE INCOME ACCOUNT | OVERPAYMENT FEE INCOME ACCOUNT|
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| activation | -1000 | | | | | | | | | | 1000 | | |
| repayment schedule Feb | 99.61 | -99.61 | | -1.15 | | | | | | | | | |
| deposit of 101 | | 99.61 | | 1.15 | | 0.23 | | | | | -101 | | 0.01 |
